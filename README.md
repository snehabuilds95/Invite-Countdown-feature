# 🎉 Let's Celebrate – Invite Countdown Web Page

Hi there! 👋  
This is a little web project I made with love to celebrate a very special moment – my brother's success in the UPSC exam. I wanted to create a digital invite page for our family lunch party, and this is what came out of it. 🥳

It’s built using Django, HTML/CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to show a live countdown timer. Simple, elegant, and joyful — just like the occasion!

## ✨ What It Does

- Shows a **beautiful landing page** with a background image.
- Has a **quote** that captures the spirit of community and support.
- Includes a **live countdown timer** to the big day (like June 15!).
- Can easily be reused for any celebration or invite with small edits.

## 💡 Why I Built It

Sometimes celebrations deserve a personal touch. I wanted to make something beyond just a message — a whole vibe. This web page makes invites feel special, like opening a little gift.
